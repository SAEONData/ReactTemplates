Houtbay Secondary in Houtbay, Ocean View Secondary in Ocean View, Masiphumelele in Fish Hoek, Sophumelela in Samora Machel Phillipi, and Usasazo secondary in Khayelitsha.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the programme is to support the development of science skills using a marine science context, encourage an interest and awareness in ocean sciences. The Node supports the school through school based monitoring programme: Argo Floats Education Project and Adopt a Drifter Programme (with NOAA). In each school a monitoring team (a group of fifteen learners and a teacher) is established to track changes at sea.\r\n\r\nFurther support include Educator Workshops where teachers are trained to integrate ocean science in the curriculum through the Argo Floats Education Project.</p>",
